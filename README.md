# StravaTools
Native iOS app utilising Strava API to provide useful additional functionalities not available in the official Strava app

## Setup

1. Create your own Strava API client ID and client secret under https://www.strava.com/settings/api .
1. Create a file in the root of this repo, called `strava.clientID` and add the client id to it
1. Create a file in the root of this repo, called `strava.clientSecret` and add the client secret to it

Note : the `strava.clientID` and `strava.clientSecret` files are gitignored so everybody can keep their own ones as a secret.
